    <h2>Press Release</h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>MESEM & Child Labor Summit</strong> was organized to draw public attention to the growing normalization of child labor under the guise of vocational education in Türkiye. Bringing together academics, journalists, civil society representatives, legal experts, and youth advocates, the summit created a critical space for dialogue on children’s rights, workplace safety, and the structural risks embedded in the MESEM system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Designed as an open and inclusive summit, the event welcomed students enrolled in MESEM programs, teachers, academics, journalists, lawyers, civil society organizations, and human rights advocates. By bringing together multiple perspectives, the summit provided a critical space to discuss how vocational education policies are increasingly turning into mechanisms of child labor exploitation.
    <p>
        The summit featured prominent speakers and participants, including Serra Kadıgil, Nevşin Mengü, Dr. Murat Özveri, Hacer Foggo, and Prof. Dr. Aziz Çelik. Discussions focused on workplace accidents involving child workers, the lack of effective inspection mechanisms, violations of children’s right to education, and the normalization of child labor—particularly in the textile and industrial sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond identifying the problems, the summit also emphasized solution-oriented policy proposals. Recommendations developed during and after the sessions aim to strengthen child labor regulations, improve occupational health and safety standards for minors, and ensure that educational policies comply with international child rights conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
        All policy recommendations and documented findings will be compiled into a formal report and submitted to the Grand National Assembly of Türkiye (TBMM) – Child Rights Commission. This step is intended to transform public discussion into concrete legislative and institutional action, ensuring that children’s rights are protected not only in theory but also in practice.

The MESEM & Child Labor Summit represents a collective call for accountability, transparency, and urgent reform—affirming that children belong in classrooms, not workplaces.
